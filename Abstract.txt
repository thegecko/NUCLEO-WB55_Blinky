The 'RTX_Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS2 based example for
ST 'STM32WB55' microcontroller using ST 'NUCLEO-WB55' Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - MSI     =            4 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           32 MHz

 - 3 LED blinks with a fixed speed.
 - blinking is paused while holding down SW1 .. SW3 buttons.


The Blinky program is available in different targets:
 - Debug:
   - Compiler optimization Level 1
   - Enabled Event Recorder
   - Keil RTX5 variant 'Source'
 - Release:
   - Compiler optimization Level 3
   - Keil RTX5 variant 'Library'
